## AutoInstall

**`AutoInstall (startpath, [filepattern], [depth])`**

Function `AutoInstall` is available to the *_usermenu.lua* script.

It looks for files whose names match `filepattern` in the directory
given by `startpath` and its subdirectories recursively,
and calls [`AddUserFile`](34.html) for each matching file found.

### Parameters

1. `startpath` (string)

A path relative to the plugin's directory

1. `filepattern` (string, or nil)

Lua regular expression specifying what files to install.
Only file name (without path) is matched against this regular
expression. If the parameter is not specified, the value
`"^_usermenu%.lua$"` is used.

1. `depth` (number, or nil)

The maximum depth of subdirectories to recurse into.
When it is 0, the search is conducted only in `startpath`.
When it is not specified, the recursion depth is unlimited.

### Warning
This function should be used with caution since it runs
every matching file found.

### Examples

      AutoInstall ("scripts")
      AutoInstall ("scripts", nil, 1)
      AutoInstall ("scripts/cool", "^_.*menu%.lua$", 0)
